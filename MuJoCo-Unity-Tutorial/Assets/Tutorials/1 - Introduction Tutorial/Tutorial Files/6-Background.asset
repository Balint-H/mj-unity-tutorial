          to Reinforcement Learning and the types of problems it is suited to tackle,
          check out the  <a href=\"https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Background-Machine-Learning.md\">summary
          from the ML-Agents project</a>. \n\n\n<b>MuJoCo:</b>\n\nMuJoCo is a physics
          engine that provides fast and realistic simulations of movements and interactions
          between objects. Communication between Unity and MuJoCo is handled by a
          plug-in, which uses an API to read and write to the state of the MuJoCo
          simulation to control it and keeps Unity synchronised with it. \n\nMuJoCo 
          has detailed documentation of its features available. If you are interested
          to learn more, the  <a href=\"https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#introduction\">introduction
          page</a>, and the <a href=\"https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unity.html\">Unity
          plug-in page</a> may be helpful references for this tutorial.\n\n\n<b>ML-Agents:</b>\n\nML-Agents
          is an open-source project supported by Unity for collecting, which provides
          a framework for collecting trajectories of observations, actions and rewards,
          based on which a policy can be trained externally, usually through Python
          ML libraries such as Tensorflow and PyTorch. ML-Agents also provides this
          functionality, making it straightforward to run and learn control policies
          with a large range of configurable features. ML-Agents also has good quality
          documentation, available on the project's <a href=\"https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unity.html\">repository</a> "
