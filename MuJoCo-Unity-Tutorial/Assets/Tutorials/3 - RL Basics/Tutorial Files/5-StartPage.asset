      Text:
        m_Untranslated: 'We loaded up a scene with an environment ready for instrumentation
          with RL components. If you''d like to use your own scene from the previous
          tutorial, feel free to load it up and continue with that instead.


          We
          will need 4 main components to learn a policy to swing the pole up and
          balance it. We need to:


          1. Reset the environment at the start
          of an episode.


          2. Collect observations at each control step
          of the simulation.


          3. Convert the actions of the policy into
          actuator commands.


          4. Issue rewards based on how well the agent
          is doing.



          Effectively you will need to add 4 components that
          handle each one of these responsibilities. There will be example scripts
          for these provided as guidance, as well as an assembled scene you can compare
          your progress with. In this tutorial you will only assemble these pre-existing
          components and inspect how they work.'
