        m_Untranslated: The Agent
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "Creating a class that inherits from the ML-Agents <b>Agent</b>
          class allows you to define learning logic for your specific agent. You
          could also define the collection of observations, handling of actions and
          rewards directly in your <b>Agent</b> class as well. Alternatively you
          can separate them into different components that provide observations and
          rewards, which can make your environment easier to manage and more modular
          to extend or modify it.\n\nHowever, one behaviour that is very convenient
          to set up in a custom Agent is its initialization. First off, create a
          new <b>GameObject</b> at the root of the scene hierarchy to house your
          new behaviours. You can call it \"RL\" for example. Then, add the <b>CartpoleAgent</b>
          component to it. This is a component custom made for this tutorial. Open
          it in your code editor to inspect it.\n\nYou'll see it needs reference
          to the two joints in the scene, the slider that is controlled by the actuator,
          and the hinge that connects the cart to the pole. You can drag the needed
          components from the Hierarchy to the respective slots. \n\n<b>OnEpisodeBegin()</b>
          is called when a new episode starts, which is where we place the resetting
          behaviour. Refer to the comments inside the script for a breakdown of the
          steps taken. Don't forget to add a <b>DecisionRequester</b> component as
          well to this <b>GameObject,</b> which signals your agent regularly to make
          predictions."
